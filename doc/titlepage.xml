<Abstract>
  We implement a discrete model of special biserial algebras and, more to the
  point, their string modules. We represent string modules using new objects
  that we call <E>strips</E>. Using these, we efficiently calculate syzygies of
  string modules in terms of the strips that represent them.

  This package builds on, an interfaces with, the &QPA; package.
  
  This package was created as part of the author's PhD thesis.

  I thank my PhD supervisor Professor Jeremy Rickard, on whom I inflicted multiple early iterations of &SBStrips;, for his time and his comments. This package was much worse before his feedback.
