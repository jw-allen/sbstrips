<#GAPDoc Label="ChapUtilities">
In this chapter, we document some additional functionalities that have been
implemented in &SBStrips; but which, really, can stand independently of it.
Others may find these useful without caring about SB algebras or what-have-you.
Among these, we include minor extensions of functionality for &QPA;

<Section>
  <Heading>Collected lists</Heading>

  Sometimes it is important to know <E>where</E> in a list an element appears.
  Sometimes, all that matters is <E>how often</E> it does. (In  mathematical
  terms, these two ideas respectively correspond to a <E>sequence</E> of
  elements and the multiset of values it takes.) One can of course move from knowing the positions of elements to just knowing their frequency, however
  this is a strict loss of information.
  <P />
  
  &GAP; implements this move using <Ref Oper="Collected"
  BookName="Reference"/>. Calls to this operation yield lists that store
  information in a more economical, if slightly less informative, fashion, of
  which &SBStrips; makes great use.
  <P />
  
  It proved convenient to build some tools for working with such "multisets".
  These tools are <E>collected</E> below (ha ha).
