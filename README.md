# The sbstrips project for QPA (in GAP)  

Copyright (C) 2020 Joe Allen

## Description

As part of my thesis at the University of Bristol, I am developing a discrete model of special biserial algebras. The main goal of this model is to encode string modules over special biserial algebras and efficiently calculate their higher syzygies. This code is intended to realise that model.

My code is intended to build on the excellent [QPA](https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/qpa.html) package of [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/index.html).

## Confession

What little I know about coding, GAP and GitHub, I've learnt through self study and/or by mimicking good examples (or at least, examples I thought were good). Altogether that's still very little; I'm certain I could do with actual training

I welcome any advice, support, notes on good practice or direction to further resources that you may have.

I'd prefer email because I am new to GitHub, but then again how else am I going to learn to use this site?
