  [1XAbstract[101X
  [33X[0;0YWe  implement a discrete model of special biserial algebras and, more to the
  point,  their  string modules. We represent string modules using new objects
  that  we  call  [13Xstrips[113X.  Using  these,  we efficiently calculate syzygies of
  string modules in terms of the strips that represent them.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  package  builds  on, an interfaces with, the [5XQPA[105X package. This package
  was created as part of the author's PhD thesis.[133X

  [33X[0;0YI  thank  my  PhD  supervisor  Professor Jeremy Rickard, on whom I inflicted
  multiple  early  iterations of [5XSBStrips[105X, for his time and his comments. This
  package was much worse before his feedback.[133X
