  [33X[0;0YThe  aim  of the [5XSBStrips[105X package is to calculate syzygies of string modules
  over special biserial (SB) algebras in a user-friendly way.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YSome historical context[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YSpecial   biserial   algebras   are   a   combinatorially-defined  class  of
  finite-dimensional   [22XK[122X-algebras   (over   some   field   [22XK[122X,   often  assumed
  algebraically closed), which have been the object of much study. Among other
  results,  their indecomposable finite-dimensional modules have been entirely
  classified  into three sorts, one of which are the [13Xstring modules[113X. These are
  so  called  because  their  module  structure  is  characterised  by certain
  decorated graphs. In the literature these graphs are called [13Xstrings[113X but, for
  our convenience (shortly to be justified), we will call them [13Xstring graphs[113X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YLiu  and Morin [LM ] proved that the syzygy [22Xâ„¦^1(X)[122X of a string module [22XX[122X is a
  direct sum of indecomposable string modules. Their proof is constructive and
  elementary:  the  former,  because  it  explicitly  gives  the string graphs
  describing  each  summand  of [22Xâ„¦^1(X)[122X from that describing [22XX[122X, and the latter,
  because they cleverly choose a basis of the projective cover [22XP(X)[122X of [22XX[122X which
  disjointly  combines  bases  of  [22Xâ„¦^1(X)[122X and [22XX[122X. In particular, their proof is
  valid  regardless  of  the  characteristic  of  the field [22XK[122X or whether it is
  algebraically closed. Consequently, we can argue that, in a very strong way,
  "taking  the  syzygy  of  a  string module" is a (many-valued) combinatorial
  operation  on  combinatorial  objects,  not  an  algebraic  one on algebraic
  objects.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  package implements that operation effectively. However, instead of the
  slightly  naive  notation/formalism used in the above article, [5XSBStrips[105X uses
  an alternative, more efficient, framework developed by the author during his
  doctoral studies. More precisely, the author devised a theoretical framework
  (to   prove   mathematical   theorems)in  that  this  package  models.  This
  theoretical framework was created with syzygy-taking in mind.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3 [33X[0;0YWhy "strips", not "strings"?[133X[101X
  
  [8X Mantra: [108X
        [33X[0;6Y[13X  If  whenever  you read the word "strip" in this package, you imagine
        that  it  means  the  kind  of  decorated  graph  that  representation
        theorists call a "string", then you won't go too far wrong. [113X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YLiu  and  Morin's  aforementioned  paper  exploits  a  kind  of  alternating
  behavior,  manifesting  from  one syzygy to the next. Through much trial and
  error,  the  author found patterns only apparent over a greater "timescale".
  It  rapidly  became impractical to [13Xdescribe[113X these greater patterns using the
  classical  notation  for  strips,  let  alone to [13Xrigorously prove[113X statements
  about them. From this necessity was born the [5XSBStrips[105X package -- or, rather,
  the abstract framework underpinning it.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOne  crucial aspect in this framework is that string graphs are refined into
  objects  called [13Xstrips[113X. This refinement is technical, does not break any new
  ground  mathematically  --  it  largely  amounts  to disambiguation and some
  algorithmic choice-making -- and so we keep it behind the scenes.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XSBStrips[105X user may safely assume that [13Xstrip[113X (or [10XIsStripRep[110X) simply means
  the kind of object that [5XGAP[105X uses to represent string graphs for SB algebras.
  As  an  added  bonus,  this  name avoids a clash with those objects that [5XGAP[105X
  already calls "strings"![133X
  
  
  [1X1.4 [33X[0;0YInstallation[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5XSBStrips[105X package was designed for version 4.11 of [5XGAP[105X; the author makes
  no  promises about compatibility with previous versions. It requires version
  1.30 of [5XQPA[105X and version 1.6 of [5XGAPDoc[105X. It is presently distributed in [10Xtar.gz[110X
  and      [10Xzip[110X      formats.      These     may     be     downloaded     from
  [7Xhttps://github.com/jw-allen/sbstrips/releases[107X   (be  sure  to  download  the
  latest version!), and then unpacked into the user's [10Xpkg[110X directory.[133X
