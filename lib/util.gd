# Some functionalities that could be present in GAP or QPA but are not

# Currently, util.gd only implements a method for <String>: a function already
#  declared in GAP.

# We therefore have nothing to declare here... but it felt asymmetric to have a
#  .gd (GAP declaration) file without the corresponding .gi (GAP implement-
#  -ation) file. So in place of actual content, we offer a bad joke.

# "What do you get when you cross a one-liner with a rhetorical question?"
