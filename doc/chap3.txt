  [33X[0;0YHere  and  throughout,  [22XK[122X  is  some  field.  By  a  [13X[22XK[122X-algebra[113X  [22XA[122X, we mean an
  associative  and  unital  (but  not  necessarily  commutative)  ring  with a
  compatible  [22XK[122X-vector  space structure. Any algebra [22XA[122X has an opposite algebra
  [22XA^op[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSuppose  [22XQ[122X  is a finite quiver: that is, a directed graph with finitely many
  vertices  and  finitely  many  arrows, where loops and/or multiple edges are
  permitted.  The  paths  of  [22XQ[122X (also called [13X[22XQ[122X-paths[113X to emphasize their parent
  quiver),  including the "stationary" paths at each vertex, form the basis of
  a  vector  space.  multiplication can be defined on basis vectors [22Xp[122X and [22Xq[122X by
  "concatenation extended by zero"; more precisely, [22Xp ⋅ q = pq[122X ("[22Xp[122X then [22Xq[122X") if
  [22Xpq[122X  is  a  path in [22XQ[122X, and [22Xp ⋅ q = 0[122X otherwise. This defines the [13Xpath algebra[113X
  [22XKQ[122X.  Its  multiplicative  unit is the sum of stationary paths. It has finite
  [22XK[122X-dimension iff [22XQ[122X contains no (directed) cycles.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YLet [22XJ ideal KQ[122X denote the [13Xarrow ideal[113X of [22XKQ[122X: the smallest two-sided ideal of
  [22XKQ[122X  containing  the arrows of [22XQ[122X. An ideal [22XI ideal KQ[122X is [13Xadmissible[113X iff there
  is an integer [22XN ≥ 2[122X with [22XJ^N ⊆ I ⊆ J^2[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBy a [13X(bound) quiver algebra[113X, we mean a quotient [22XKQ/I[122X of a path algebra [22XKQ[122X by
  an  admissible ideal [22XI[122X. Quiver algebras are always finite-dimensional [ASS ,
  Sec   II.2].   Indeed,   at  least  when  [22XK[122X  is  algebraically  closed,  any
  finite-dimensional   algebra   is   a   direct  product  of  connected  ones
  (trivially),  any  connected finite-dimensional algebra is Morita equivalent
  to  a  basic  one  [ASS  ,  Sec  I.6]  and  any  basic, connected algebra is
  isomorphic to a quiver algebra [ASS , Sec II.3].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn this document, we assume that [22XK[122X is algebraically closed and [22XA[122X is a quiver
  algebra  [22XKQ/I[122X.  By the above, this is no loss of generality. We also use the
  term  [22XA[122X-path  to  mean  a  nonzero  element [22Xp+I[122X represented by a path of the
  quiver.[133X

  [33X[0;0YA  representation  of  [22XA[122X  is a homomorphism of algebras [22Xϕ : A -> End X[122X whose
  target  is  the  endomorphism  algebra  [22XEnd  X[122X  of  a  [22XK[122X-vector space [22XX[122X; for
  convenience,  write  [22Xϕ_a[122X  for the image of [22Xa[122X in [22Xϕ[122X. In this case, we call [22XX[122X a
  [13X(right)  [22XA[122X-module[113X,  with  associated  action  [22Xx  ⋅  a  = xϕ_a[122X. The module is
  [13Xfinite-dimensional[113X iff [13XX[113X is.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSince  [22XA=KQ/I[122X,  we  can work in terms of [13X(bound) representations of quivers[113X.
  These  are  assignments  of  a  vector space [22XX_i[122X to each vertex [22Xi[122X of [22XQ[122X and a
  linear  map [22Xθ_α : X_i -> X_j[122X to each arrow [22Xα : i -> j[122X of [22XQ[122X such that for any
  [22Xρ  =  ∑_k=1^m  p_kλ_k ∈ I[122X, the associated map [22X∑_k=1^m θ_p_k : ⨁_i X_i -> ⨁_i
  X_i[122X  is zero. Here, [22Xθ_p_k=θ_α_1⋯θ_α_r[122X for a decomposition of a nonstationary
  [22Xp_k[122X into a product [22Xα_1⋯α_r[122X of arrows, and [22Xθ_i=id_X_i[122X for any stationary path
  at [22Xi[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs is well-known [ASS , III.1], representations of quivers are equivalent to
  modules.   More  specifically,  the  categories  [22XRep(Q,I)[122X  of  bound  quiver
  representations   and  [22XModcat  A[122X  of  [22XA[122X-modules  are  equivalent,  and  this
  equivalence  restricts  to  their respective full subcategories [22Xrep(Q,I)[122X and
  [22Xmodcat  A[122X  of  finite-dimensional objects. In keeping with the quiver-minded
  approach  from  above, whenever we say module, we really mean the equivalent
  bound quiver representation.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  note  in particular that all of the categories in the previous paragraph
  are  abelian:  thus, we can speak of the direct sum of modules (denoted with
  [22X⊕[122X)  .  We call a module [22XX[122X [13Xindecomposable[113X if [22XX = Y⊕ Z[122X implies [22XY[122X or [22XZ[122X is zero.
  Further, if [22XmathcalU[122X is any set of [22XA[122X-modules, we define the additive closure
  [22Xadd  mathcalU[122X  of [22XmathcalU[122X as the full subcategory of [22Xmodcat A[122X whose objects
  are  isomorphic  to  direct  summands  of  finite  direct sums of members of
  [22XmathcalU[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWrite  [22X[X][122X  for  the  isomorphism  type  of  [22XX[122X. One can seek to classify the
  isomorphism  classes  of  indecomposable  (finite-dimensional) modules of an
  algebra.   A   deep   theorem   of   Drozd   [Dro  ]  establishes  that  all
  finite-dimensional  algebras  fall  into exactly one of three [13Xrepresentation
  types[113X.  In  increasing  order  of difficulty, the options are [13Xrepresentation
  finite[113X,  [13Xtame[113X  or [13Xwild[113X. The first simply means the algebra has only finitely
  many  isoclasses  of indecomposables. Speaking informally, tame algebras are
  those  for  which,  in  each  dimension,  almost  all  modules lie in one of
  finitely  many  classes  each parameterized by the field. Speaking even more
  informally,  wild algebras are those for which the classification problem is
  intractible  in  a  very  strong  way.  Discussion and formal definitions of
  representation type can be found in [Ben , Sec 4.4].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  are  certain canonical classes of module. A module [22XX[122X is: [13Xsimple[113X if it
  has  no  proper,  nonzero  submodules;  [13Xprojective[113X  if the covariant functor
  [22XHom_A(X,-):  Modcat  A  ->  Modcat  Z[122X is exact, or; [13Xinjective[113X if the functor
  [22XHom_A(-,X)   :  Modcat  A  ->  Modcat  Z[122X  is  exact.  The  simple  [22XA[122X-modules
  (necessarily  indecomposable)  are  in  one-to-one  correspondence  with the
  vertices  of  [22XQ[122X, as are the indecomposable projective and injective modules.
  We  respectively  write  [22XS_i[122X,  [22XP_i[122X  and  [22XI_i[122X  for the simple, indecomposable
  projective  and  indecomposable injective module corresponding to the vertex
  [22Xi[122X.  We  also  write  [22Xprojcat A[122X and [22Xinjcat A[122X to for the full subcategories of
  [22Xmodcat  A[122X whose objects are respectively the (finite-dimensional) projective
  and injective modules.[133X

  submodules form a chain.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  write  [22XD[122X  for  the vector-space duality [22XHom_K(-, K) : modcat A -> modcat
  A^op[122X  of modules (and its inverse) and we write [22X*[122X for the dualities [22XHom_A(-,

  [1X3.3 [33X[0;0YSyzygies and related constructions[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  this  section,  we  describe certain module constructions which refer to
  projective  presentations  (described  below).  These  constructions  do not
  generally  extend  to functors on the module category because they depend on
  the  presentation chosen. However, this dependence is usually only up to the
  adding  or  removing  of  projective  direct  summands.  By  working  in the
  finite-dimensional   universe  [22Xmodcat  A[122X  where  the  Krull-Schmidt  theorem
  applies,  we  can  reduce  to  study  of  modules  having  no indecomposable
  projective   direct   summands.   These  objects  admit  minimal  projective
  presentations.  This  approach  suffices for [5XSBStrips[105X, since we will only be
  interested in constructions on modules and not their functorial extension to
  morphisms. Readers who care for the functorial approach should interpret the
  following  in  the  (projectively)  stable  module category [22Xpstmodcat A[122X: its
  objects  are  those of the usual module category [22Xmodcat A[122X and its hom-spaces
  are the quotients of their counterparts in [22Xmodcat A[122X by the subspaces of maps
  that  factor  through  projective  modules. They should also be aware of the
  injectively  stable  module  category  [22Xistmodcat  A[122X,  similarly  obtained by
  quotienting my maps factoring through injectives.[133X

  [22Xw[122X  of  any  [22XΓ[122X-path  [22Xp[122X is linearly independent of all other [22XA[122X-paths. A string
  graph  [22Xw[122X is commonly depicted by labelling each vertex and arrow of [22XΓ[122X by its
  respective images in [22XQ[122X. Then vertices of [22Xw[122X provide a basis of the associated
  string  module,  and  the  labels  describe  the [22XA[122X action. We can identify a
  string graph with the string module it represents.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOne  subtle  point:  here,  we do not require string graphs to be connected;
  accordingly we do require string modules to be indecomposable.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  dual  [22XD  X[122X,  the  transpose  [22XTr X[122X and the syzygy [22Xsyzygy^1 X[122X of a string
  module  [22XX[122X  are  all  string  modules, albeit for the opposite algebra in the
  first  two  cases  [WW  , Sec 3] [LM , Sec 2]. In as-yet-unpublished work of
  Galstad  [Gal]  (and  publicized without proof by Huisgen-Zimmermann [Hui ])
  the syzygy of a band module [22XX[122X is also a string module provided that at least
  one indecomposable direct summand of [22XPP X[122X is a string module.[133X
