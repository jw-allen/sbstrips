This is the README file for SBStrips (v0.6.0), which is a package for GAP 4.5.

+--+ About +------------------------------------------------------------------+
The SBStrips package models 'strings', namely the decorated graphs used in
representation theory. These graphs are known to describe a type of module for
a special biserial algebra called a string module. The syzygy of a string
module is a direct sum of string modules; hence syzygy-taking is essentially a
one-to-many operation on strings. The SBStrips package implements 'strings' as
a data structure called 'strips', and performs this syzygy calculation.

The SBStrips package is designed for version >=4.5.x of GAP, requiring version
>=1.27.x of QPA (another package for GAP).

The SBStrips package is being written by me, Joe Allen, during my doctoral
studies at the University of Bristol. In my thesis, I am developing a
combinatorial model of special biserial algebras and their string modules.
This package is the implementation in GAP of (aspects of) that model.

+--+ Installation +-----------------------------------------------------------+
The SBStrips can be installed by following these steps (assuming you already
have GAP installed.)

    1. Download the archive file 
            sbstrips/archive/v0.6.0.tar.gz
       from
            https://github.com/jw-allen/sbstrips/archive/v0.6.0.tar.gz
        
    2. Unpack it into your  pkg  directory. It should create a subdirectory
       called  sbstrips.
    
    3. Run GAP as normal and type
            LoadPackage( "sbstrips" );
       at the GAP prompt.
