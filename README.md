# The sbstrips project for QPA (in GAP)  

Copyright (C) 2020 Joe Allen

## Description

As part of my thesis at the University of Bristol, I am developing a discrete model of special biserial algebras. The main goal of this model is to encode string modules over special biserial algebras and efficiently calculate their higher syzygies. This code is intended to realise that model.

My code is intended to build on the excellent QPA package of GAP.
