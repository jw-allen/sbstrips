<Abstract>
  String modules for special biserial (SB) algebras are represented by string
  graphs. The syzygy of a string module (over an SB algebra) is a direct sum of
  string modules, by a 2004 result of Liu and Morin, therefore syzygy-taking
  can be performed at the (combinatorial) level of string graphs rather than
  the (homological-algebraic) level of modules.
  <P />
  
  This package represents string graphs in &GAP; by objects called strips and
  it implements syzygy-taking as an operation on them. Together with some
  utilities for book-keeping, it allows for very efficient calculation of
  <M>k</M>th syzygyies for large <M>k</M>.

  I thank my PhD supervisor Prof Jeremy Rickard, on whom I inflicted multiple
  early iterations of &SBStrips;, for his time and his comments. This package
  was much worse before his feedback. I also thank my fellow members of "Team
  Splendid" -- Charley Cummings, Luke Kershaw and Dr Simon Peacock -- for
  countless engaging conversations about representation theory, programming
  and much else besides.

  Additionally, I received help understanding <Package>GAPDoc</Package> from
  Prof Max Horn and Dr Frank LÃ¼beck, the latter of whom wrote the
  <F>makedocrel.g</F> file included in this package. I am grateful to them
  both.
