<Abstract>
  We implement a discrete model of special biserial algebras and, more to the
  point, their string modules. We represent string modules using new objects
  that we call <E>strips</E>. Using these, we efficiently calculate syzygies of
  string modules in terms of the strips that represent them.

  This package builds on, an interfaces with, the &QPA; package.
  
  This package was created as part of the author's PhD thesis.

  I thank my PhD supervisor Prof Jeremy Rickard, on whom I inflicted multiple
  early iterations of &SBStrips;, for his time and his comments. This package
  was much worse before his feedback.

  Additionally, I received help understanding <Package>GAPDoc</Package> from
  Prof Max Horn and Dr Frank LÃ¼beck, the latter of whom wrote the
  <F>makedocrel.g</F> file included in this package. I am grateful to them
  both.
