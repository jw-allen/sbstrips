  [1X2.1 [33X[0;0YStrips, aka "strings for special biserial algebras"[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  package  is  principally for "strings and their syzygies". Strings are
  defined  over  special  biserial (SB) algebras. Our first job is to tell [5XGAP[105X
  about  a  SB  algebra.  We'll do this using tools from [5XQPA[105X. If the following
  doesn't make sense to you, then see the QPA documentation [ ].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn  important rule is that the SB algebra be presented by [13Xmonomial relations
  [113X  and [13Xskew commutativity relations[113X. A monomial relation is just a path [22Xp[122X (or
  more  generally  [22XÎ»  p[122X  for  some  coefficient  in  the  ambient  field, here
  [10XRationals[110X). A (skew) commutativity relation is a linear difference [22XÎ» p - Î¼ q[122X
  of  paths  [22Xp,q[122X  having  common  source  and  target,  where  [22XÎ»,Î¼[122X are nonzero
  coefficients.   It   is  well-known  that  all  SB  algebras  admit  such  a
  presentation; [5XSBStrips[105X takes it for granted you have used one.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThis  defines  a  special  biserial  algebra  [10Xalg2[110X.  The  following  is what
  representation  theorists call a string over [10Xalg2[110X, but which we'll prefer to
  call a [13Xstrip[113X. (For reasons why, see Section [14X1.1[114X.)[133X

  [1X2.2 [33X[0;0YModules from strips[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YRepresentation  theorists  will  know  that  this  strip [10Xs[110X corresponds to an
  indecomposable  module  over  [10Xalg2[110X.  In the literature they're called string
  modules,  but maybe here we could call them strip modules? Whatever you want
  to call it, that module can be made in [5XGAP[105X using [2XModuleOfStrip[102X ([14X3.6-1[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  technicality  to  bear  in  mind  is that that module is implemented as a
  representation  of  the  quiver  over  which  [10Xalg2[110X  was defined. You'll find
  details about quiver representations in the [5XQPA[105X documentation.[133X

  [33X[0;0YYou  can  turn  a  list of strips into a list of modules using [2XModuleOfStrip[102X
  ([14X3.6-1[114X).  You  can turn a collected list (see below [13XADD REFERENCE[113X) of strips
  into a collected list of modules using [2XModuleOfStrip[102X ([14X3.6-1[114X). If you want to
  turn  a  list  or  collected list of strips into a single module, namely the
  direct  sum  of  all  the  modules represented by strips in your list, it is
  better to call [10XDirectSumModuleOfStrip[110X.[133X
  
  
  [1X2.3 [33X[0;0YSyzygies of strips[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YNow,  you [13Xcan[113X calculate the syzygy of [10XX[110X using [5XQPA[105X's function [2X1stSyzygy[102X ([14XQPA:
  1stSyzygy[114X)  on  [10XX[110X  if  you  really  want.  It'll  give you the syzygy module
  [10X\Omega^1(X)[110X as another quiver representation.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YHowever,  you  should  know that the syzygy of a string module [22XX[122X is a direct
  sum  of string modules. Suppose we write this as [22Xâ„¦^1 (X) = X_1 âŠ• â‹¯ âŠ• X_m[122X. It
  turns  out  that syzygies may be computed in an algorithmic fashion, just at
  the  level of "strings". In other words, you give me the "string" describing
  [22XX[122X  and I give you the "strings" describing each summand [22XX_j[122X of its syzygy in
  turn.  This  result was proved constructively by Liu and Morin in their 2004
  paper  [13XADD  REFERENCE[113X  using  a pseudoalgorithm. The purpose of the [5XSBStrips[105X
  package  is  to  formalize  this  pseudoalgorithm  and  implement it in [5XGAP[105X.
  Instead  of "strings", which can be ambiguous, we use strips. Our added care
  pays off when examining asymoptotic syzygy behavior of strings.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YRecall  our  strip  [10Xs[110X  from above. Let's start calculating its syzygies. The
  operation   [10XSyzygyOfStrip[110X   returns   a   list   of  strips,  one  for  each
  indecomposable direct summand of the syzygy of its input.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThis example shows that the syzygy of [10Xs[110X has [22X3[122X indecomposable summands.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOf  course,  there's  no reason to stop at [22X1[122Xst syzygies. [5XSBStrips[105X is able to
  take  higher  syzygies  very  easily  (but  refer  to the next section for a

  [33X[0;0YNote that many strips occur multiple times in this [10X4th_syz[110X. (What this means
  mathematically  is  that many of those summands are isomorphic.) If you want
  to  remove duplicates from the above list (which is like looking at just the
  isomorphism types of modules in the direct sum), then the most efficient way
  is   with  [2XSet[102X  ([14XReference:  Set[114X).  Alternatively,  you  can  use  [2XCollected[102X
  ([14XReference:   Collected[114X).   This   turn  the  list  into  something  that  a
  mathematician  might  call  a  multiset.  That  is,  the distinct strips are
  recorded along with their frequency in the list.[133X

  [33X[0;0Y(In  the  next  section,  we  pause  to  discuss  the  efficiency  of  these
  "collected" methods.)[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  reiterate  that  the lists (resp. collected lists) of strips returned by
  [10XSyzygyOfStrip[110X  (resp.  [10XCollectedSyzygyOfStrip[110X)  and  its [10XNth[110X variants may be
  turned  into  lists  (resp. collected lists) of quiver representations using
  [10XModuleOfStrip[110X.  These  may  alternatively be turned into a single direct sum

  [1X2.4 [33X[0;0YComputing higher syzygies efficiently[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  central  point in my thesis [13X(reference!)[113X is that the syzygies of a string
  module   should   be  arranged  in  a  particular  format.  (A  little  more
  specifically,  they  should  be  written into a certain kind of array.) This
  format  does  not  print nicely onto the Euclidean plane so, sadly, there is
  little  hope of [5XGAP[105X displaying syzygies in the most optimal way. The closest
  it  can get -- which is not very close at all, frankly -- is the list format
  returned   by   [10XSyzygyOfStrip[110X  or  [10XNthSyzygyOfStrip[110X.  However,  this  format
  compresses  lots  into  a  single line. This loses information and becomes a
  very  inefficient  way to store data (let along compute with them). By using
  functions       like       [10XCollected[110X,       [10XCollectedSyzygyOfStrip[110X       and
  [10XCollectedNthSyzygyOfStrip[110X,   we   lose  what  little  information  the  list
  presentation holds onto, but we streamline out calculations greatly.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  see this, consider the [22X20[122Xth syzygy of [10Xs[110X. The following calculation shows
  that  it  has  [22X344732[122X  distinct summands (many of which will be isomorphic);
  this took over [22X2[122X minutes to perform on my device.[133X

  [33X[0;0YFirst,  some  general  theory about finite-dimensional algebras. Recall that
  (the  isomorphism  classes  of) the simple modules over an SB algebra are in
  one-to-one correspondence with the vertices of its ordinary quiver. The same
  is  true  for  the  indecomposable projective modules and the indecomposable
  injective  modules.  (It  is  also  true  for  any finite-dimensional quiver
  algebra,  more  generally.)  In  this section, suppose that the vertices are
  [22Xi_1,   dots,  i_n[122X,  and  that  the  simple,  indecomposable  projective  and
  indecomposable  injective  modules associated to vertex [22Xi_r[122X are respectively
  [22XS_r[122X, [22XP_r[122X and [22XI_r[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAll of the simple modules over an SB algebra are string modules. The list of
  strips that describe them can be obtained using the following command.[133X

  [33X[0;0Y(If  a  projective  or  injective  module over an SB algebra is not a string
  module,  then  it  must  be  [13Xp[113Xrojective,  [13Xi[113Xnjective  and  [13Xn[113Xonuniserial. Such
  modules, which we call [13Xpin[113X modules (can you see why?) are not implemented in

  [33X[0;0YThe  uniserial  modules are also, in particular, string modules. They are in

  [33X[0;0YIn  the  first  example,  [10Xa[110X and [10Xb[110X are the names of arrows in the quiver with
  which  [10Xalg2[110X  was  presented.  The  residue of the arrow [10Xa[110X in [10Xalg2[110X is [10Xalg2.a[110X;
  similarly,  [10Xalg2.b[110X. Their product [10Xalg2.a * alg2.b[110X is the residue of the path
  [10Xa  * b[110X in the quiver (where [10Xa * b[110X means "[10Xa[110X then [10Xb[110X"). This is what we mean by
  a  path  in the SB algebra: products of (residues of) arrows and vertices in
  the algebra.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  see  that  vertices  or  arrows  of  the SB algebra (such as [10Xalg2.v1[110X and
  [10Xalg2.c[110X)  are  paths too. We also see an example of the [10X^[110X operation: [10Xalg2.d^3[110X
  is equivalent to [10Xalg2.d * alg2.d * alg2.d[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSince  vertices are still paths (trivially) and simple modules are uniserial

  [33X[0;0YNow  that we've implement strips, we should play around with them. Let's see
  some  of  the  fun  tests built into [5XSBStrips[105X! For this, we'll introduce the
  algebra  [10Xalg1[110X.  It  is  the  Nakayama algebra [22XKQ/J^4[122X, where [22XQ[122X is the [22X3[122X-cycle
  quiver with arrows [22Xa[122X, [22Xb[122X and [22Xc[122X,[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y,  where [22XJ[122X is the [22X4[122Xth power of the arrow ideal of [22XKQ[122X, and where [22XK=â„š[122X. (Really
  [22XK[122X could be any field.)[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  algebra  is  chosen  because  it  is  much  more boring than [10Xalg2[110X. For
  instance,  as a monomial algebra, [10Xalg1[110X is [13Xsyzygy-finite[113X. Roughly, this means
  that  the  class of syzygies stabilizes. More precisely, it means that there
  is  some  integer  [22X0  â‰¤  m  <  âˆž[122X and a finite set [22XmathcalS[122X of indecomposable
  modules such that, for any module [22XX[122X, the indecomposable summands of [22Xâ„¦^m( X )[122X
  belong  to  [22XmathcalS[122X.  (By  a  result  of Zimmermann Huisgen [13XREFERENCE![113X, [22Xm=2[122X
  works.)  But,  in  fact,  we  can  say something stronger. Because [10Xalg2[110X is a
  Nakayama  algebra,  it  is  [13Xrepresentation  finite[113X (so, in fact, [22Xm=0[122X works).
